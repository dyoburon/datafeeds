In the AI portfolio part of the app, here's how it should work: It 
should take in all the elements of the users profile: investment philosophy,
 current portfolio and goals. Use knowledge level to know what level of 
explanation to give them for your analysis. It should grab the current 
market days market analysis as well. After ingesting all of this it should 
spit out any changes of allocations recommended based on their investment 
portfolio goals etc. It should consider macroeconomic factors to some degree
 unless the users investment philosophy differs. Also in your analysis 
include potential investment thesis based on the general themes of their 
portfolio. For example, if they are really concentrated in an AI narrative, 
try to find an uncorrelated secular trend that might be interesting. I 
included a file called secular_trends.txt to get inspiration. Your 
recommendations should comply with modern portfolio theory. 
Secular_trends.txt is located in backend/secular_trends.txt. Use this file 
as inspiration in finding new ideas. Your ideas should always include an 
allocation recommendation. These allocation recommendations should be based 
in a professional poker level understanding of bet size (kelly criterion 
etc). It should be an allocation % that optimizes sharpe ratio.
